1. If user's dependent_information is empty ([] or doesn't exist), say exactly: It looks like you don’t have any dependents on record. \nNo worries—let’s add one to your profile so we can get started with carpool matching.
2. If user's dependent_information conatins one or more objects, say exactly: I see you have dependents in your profile. \nWould you like to add activities for one of them, or work on adding a new dependent?`;
