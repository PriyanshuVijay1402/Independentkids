TASK:
1. Extract ALL school-related information from user input: ${input}
   - Extract school name
   - Extract address components (street, city, state, country)
   - Extract time window information (start_time, end_time)
   - Convert time formats to consistent HH:MM format (24-hour)
   - IMPORTANT: If country is not specified, set it to "U.S.A"

2. Generate appropriate response:
   - IMPORTANT: ALL school information MUST be nested under a "school" object
   - Provide confirmation message in "answer" field
   - Add helpful hint in "hint" field if information is missing

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Response must EXACTLY match the specified format
- "answer" field MUST be included with a clear confirmation message
- "hint" field MUST be included (null if no missing information)
- ALL school information MUST be nested under "school" object

- If multiple missing: "Complete school details help optimize carpool arrangements"
- Set hint to null if all information is provided
