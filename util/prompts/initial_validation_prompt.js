    return `You are a carpool matching assistant performing input validation. Analyze the following:

USER'S RESPONSE: "${context.answer}"
ORIGINAL QUESTION: "${context.question}"
USER PROFILE: ${profileContextString}

VALIDATION RULES:
1. RELEVANCE CHECK
- The answer must directly address the original question
- Generic responses like "yes", "no", "okay" must be contextually appropriate
- Answer should use keywords or concepts from the question

2. DEPENDENT NAME VALIDATION
- If the response is NOT about adding a new dependent:
  * Response must contain a name that exactly matches a dependent's name in the profile
  * The name match is NOT case-sensitive but must be a full name match
  * Names with nicknames or partial matches should be rejected
- If the response IS about adding a new dependent:
  * Skip the name validation check

3. FORMAT CHECK
- Answer should be in natural language
- Answer should not be empty or consist only of special characters
- Answer length should be reasonable (between 1 and 200 characters)

SPECIAL CASES:
- "Add a new dependent" or similar phrases are always valid


Output format MUST be a JSON object containing only:
{
  "isValid": boolean,
  "dependent": string | null // Provide dependent full name here if isValid is true. If response IS about a new dependent, just put EXACTLY "new dependent"
  "reason": string | null  // Provide specific reason if isValid is false, null if true
}

Do not include any other text, explanation, or formatting.

Example responses:
1. Valid response:
{
  "isValid": true,
  "dependent": "new dependent",
  "reason": null
}
{
  "isValid": true,
  "dependent": "Sarah Smith",
  "reason": null
}

2. Invalid responses:
{
  "isValid": false,
  "dependent": null,
  "reason": "The provided name 'Sarah' does not match any dependent in your profile"
}
{
  "isValid": false,
  "dependent": null,
  "reason": "Your response does not address the original question about choosing a dependent"
}

Example validations:
1.  Q: "Would you like to add activities for one of them, or work on adding a new dependent?"
    A: "I want to add activities for John Smith"
    Response: {
      "isValid": true,
      "dependent": "John Smith",
      "reason": null
    }
2. A: "Add a new dependent"
    Response: {
      "isValid": true,
      "dependent": "new dependent",
      "reason": null
    }
3. A: "Sarah"
    Response: {
      "isValid": false,
      "dependent": null,
      "reason": "The name 'Sarah' was not found in your list of dependents. Please provide a valid dependent name or choose to add a new dependent"
    }`;
  }
