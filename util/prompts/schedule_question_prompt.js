const prompts = {
  scheduleQuestion: (profileContext, preference, input) => {

Current profile context:

Sharing preferences: ${preferenceString}

Given the user input "${input}", create a schedule list where each entry represents a day when the activity occurs.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPLIT SHARING:
When sharing_type is "split":
- When a user explicitly states they are NOT available on a day, include that day with transport_availability: null
- For days where they ARE available, transport_availability should ONLY be included when EXPLICITLY provided in the user input
- Do NOT create or infer transport_availability if not explicitly given
- If transport availability is required but not provided:
  * Set isComplete to false
  * Include a hint message requesting transport availability for specific days
  * Include the days in the schedule output without transport_availability
- Do NOT create a schedule with only day_of_week information
- Do NOT set isComplete to true unless ALL days have transport_availability defined (either with times or explicitly set to null)

RULES:
1. Day Parsing:
   - Convert day names or abbreviations to numbers (1-7, where 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday, 6=Saturday, 7=Sunday)
   - Accept full names (Monday), abbreviations (Mon), or single letters (M)
   - Handle combinations (Monday and Wednesday, Mon & Wed, M/W)
   - Each day should only appear once
   - When user explicitly states they are not available on a day, include it with transport_availability: null

2. Transport Availability Rules:
   - If willing_to_share_rides is false: create entries with only day_of_week
   - If sharing_type is "rotation": create entries with only day_of_week
   - If sharing_type is "split": MUST follow CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS above
   - ONLY include transport_availability when times are EXPLICITLY provided in user input
   - Pickup/dropoff windows must use "HH:MM" format
   - Set transport_availability to null when user explicitly states they are not available

3. Schedule Creation:
   - If no valid days found: return empty schedule with hint message
   - If days found: create schedule entries following above rules strictly
   - For split sharing: NEVER create transport_availability unless explicitly provided or explicitly set to null

Output must be valid JSON with this structure:
{
  "answer": "Brief explanation of what was processed",
  "schedule": [
    {
      "day_of_week": number,
      "transport_availability"?: {
        "pickup_window"?: {
          "start_time": string,
          "end_time": string
        },
        "dropoff_window"?: {
          "start_time": string,
          "end_time": string
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "hint": "Help message if needed",
  "isComplete": boolean
}

Example outputs:

1. Basic schedule (no sharing):
{
  "answer": "Schedule set for Monday (1) and Wednesday (3)",
  "schedule": [
    {"day_of_week": 1},
    {"day_of_week": 3}
  ],
  "hint": "",
  "isComplete": true
}

2. Split sharing WITH explicitly provided transport availability and unavailability:
{
  "answer": "Schedule set with transport availability as provided. Monday marked as unavailable.",
  "schedule": [
    {
      "day_of_week": 1,
      "transport_availability": null
    },
    {
      "day_of_week": 3,
      "transport_availability": {
        "pickup_window": {
          "start_time": "18:00",
          "end_time": "18:10"
        },
        "dropoff_window": {
          "start_time": "16:30",
          "end_time": "16:45"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "hint": "",
  "isComplete": true
}

3. Split sharing WITHOUT transport availability:
{
  "answer": "Days identified but transport availability is required for split sharing",
  "schedule": [
    {"day_of_week": 1},
    {"day_of_week": 3}
  ],
  "hint": "Please provide transport availability (pickup/dropoff times) for Monday and Wednesday as required for split sharing",
  "isComplete": false
}

4. Split sharing with PARTIAL transport availability:
{
  "answer": "Schedule is incomplete - missing transport availability for Wednesday",
  "schedule": [
    {
      "day_of_week": 1,
      "transport_availability": {
        "dropoff_window": {
          "start_time": "15:30",
          "end_time": "15:50"
        }
      }
    },
    {"day_of_week": 3}
  ],
  "hint": "Please provide transport availability (pickup/dropoff times) for Wednesday as required for split sharing",
  "isComplete": false
}

5. Invalid input:
{
  "answer": "I need to know which days of the week the activity takes place",
  "schedule": [],
  "hint": "Please specify which day(s) of the week the activity occurs (e.g., Monday and Wednesday, or Mon/Wed)",
  "isComplete": false
}`
  }
};
