Current profile context:

Given the user input "${input}", create a schedule list where each entry represents a day when the activity occurs.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPLIT SHARING:
When sharing_type is "split":
1. When ONLY days are provided (e.g., "M,W" or "Monday and Wednesday"):
   * Create schedule entries with ONLY day_of_week field
   * DO NOT include transport_availability field at all
   * Set isComplete to false with a hint requesting transport availability

2. When transport availability is provided WITHOUT specific days:
   * MUST apply the same transport availability to ALL existing days in the schedule
   * This includes cases where user says "everyday" or just provides times without mentioning days
   * Example: If schedule has Monday and Wednesday, and user says "can pickup 3-4pm", apply this time to BOTH days

3. When transport availability is provided WITH specific days:
   * Only update the specified days with the provided availability
   * Do not modify other days' availability
   * Each day can have different transport availability
   * Example: "dropoff 4:30-4:45pm on Mon, pickup 6-6:10pm on Tue" creates separate entries for Monday and Tuesday

4. When a user explicitly states they are NOT available on a day:
   * Include that day with transport_availability: null

5. General Rules:
   * Do NOT create or infer transport_availability if not explicitly given
   * Do NOT set isComplete to true unless ALL days have transport_availability defined
   * If transport availability is required but not provided:
     - Set isComplete to false
     - Include a hint message requesting transport availability
     - Include the days in the schedule output without transport_availability

RULES:
1. Day Parsing:
   - Convert day names or abbreviations to numbers (1-7, where 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday, 6=Saturday, 7=Sunday)
   - Accept full names (Monday), abbreviations (Mon), or single letters (M)
   - Handle combinations (Monday and Wednesday, Mon & Wed, M/W)
   - Each day should only appear once

2. Transport Availability Rules:
   - If willing_to_share_rides is false: create entries with only day_of_week
   - If sharing_type is "rotation": create entries with only day_of_week
   - If sharing_type is "split": MUST follow CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS above
   - ONLY include transport_availability when times are EXPLICITLY provided
   - When transport availability is provided without specific days:
     * MUST apply the SAME availability to ALL existing days in the schedule
     * Do NOT add new days to the schedule
   - Pickup/dropoff windows must use "HH:MM" format

3. Schedule Creation:
   - If no valid days found: return empty schedule with hint message
   - If days found: create schedule entries following above rules strictly
   - When only days are mentioned: create entries with ONLY day_of_week field
   - When times are provided without specific days: apply to ALL existing days
